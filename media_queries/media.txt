Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to smart TVs ,desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).


The result of the query is true When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.

Unless you use the not or only operators, the media type is optional and the all type will be implied.

You can also have different stylesheets for different media:





meaning of the not, only and and keywords:

not: The not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query.

only: The only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.

and: The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features.

They are all optional. However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a media type.
